ðŸ’€ Death Extension ðŸ’€

This is a simple example of a Chrome extension of how to load a cross-site javascript through a [Google Chrome extension](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted).

Since this won't ever be in the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/), you should download or clone this repo and load it into Chrome in [developer mode](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked).
